# Getting Started

Welcome to the FNNLib manual. While FNNLib is in development, this manual will likely fall behind of its current capabilities and thus may not teach you everything you need to know about the library. It is recommended to either learn from the API Reference or, if you are newer to networking, to wait until FNNLib can be considered stable and ready for production (Which could be anywhere from months to even a year).

Please feel to contribute either to the manual, or even the library itself. I am grateful for any help I can get.
